        <p>This website is about the demonstration of the range of my skills sets in the feild of engineering,
            activities that involves the community and a number of interests that I would like to delve into in the future.  
        </p>
        <p><h3 style="text-align:center;">Activities</h3></p>
        <p>Activities in the community I reside in, 1) could be football coaching young kids who are heading to a wrong path due to few or no amusement

        <p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Skills</h3></p>
        <p> I have a wide range of skills that I have aqcuired while doing electrical engineering. A significant skill would be solution orientated thinking.
            <br>
            eg.
            1. Identifying the problem & I isolate it. 2. Define the problem. 3. Identify root causes. 4. and find a sutable and reasonable solution 6. Implement the solution.
        <p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Interests</h3></p>
        <p>  Interests that I can highlight include 1980s engines, Arduino and control techniques, technical football, and software development. .</p>
